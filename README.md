## Description
wrfhydrpy is a Python API for the WRF-Hydro modelling system. The goal of this project is to provide a clean, feature-rich, and unified API for interacting with the many components of the WRF-Hydro modelling system.

### Testing
All new functions or classes must be accompanied by additional unit/integration tests in the `wrf_hydro_py/wrfhydropy/tests` directory.
If tests require complex or large data objects, those objects need to be created and placed in the `wrf_hydro_py/wrfhydropy/tests/data` directory.
Additionally, test data should be able to reproduced using the test script. See [test_WrfHydroClasses.py](https://github.com/NCAR/wrf_hydro_py/blob/master/wrfhydropy/tests/test_WrfHydroClasses.py) for an example.

## Documentation
Documentation will be forthcoming once the API becomes more stable.
